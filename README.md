Welcome to this Java Spring Boot project, featuring a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API, integrated with Spring JPA for database operations and PostgreSQL as the database. Additionally, the project includes a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java:** Contains the Java source code for the project.
- **src/main/resources:** Holds configuration files, application properties, etc.
- **pom.xml:** Manages project dependencies using Maven.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Docker

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Database Configuration
